# Back to Earth 

Your spaceship is in terrible condition after your spacemission. To get it fixed you need to go back home, Earth. Control the spaceship to manuever your way back to Earth. Use arrow keys to navigate through space. The arrow keys to have to be continuously pressed in the direction you wish to move for the rocket to keep moving. 

The rocket journey starts at 3 seconds and is being timed for 40 seconds before oxygen will be depleted. 

If you have successfully made it to Earth under 40 seconds, you will get a good ending. Failing to reach the Earth witin 40 seconds or trying to head to the comet direction will lead you to a bad ending.

Depending on the ending you might need to press keys or click your mouse to return to the menu scree.

# Something to look out in the program

 Reloading the game is highly recommonmened because the rocket location will stay at the location where the player has last left it at. 
 
 The game begins with 3 seconds instead of 0.
