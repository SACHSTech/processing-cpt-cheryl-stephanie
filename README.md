# Back to Earth 

# Objective of the game:
Welcome to "Back to Earth"! The spaceship is in a terrible condition after your spacemission. To get it fixed, you need to go back home--Earth. Control the spaceship to manuever your way back to Earth before oxygen gets depleted!

# Gameplay mechanics & User interaction
User starts the game at menu screen and activates the game by pressing 's' key to start. 
Spaceship starts at the top left corner of the screen. Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to navigate through space. The spaceship is moved one tile at a time. The arrow keys have to be continuously pressed by user in the direction wished to move for the rocket to keep moving. 
In space, there are moon blocks that restricts the spaceship's movements. The goal is to manuever around the moon blocks and travel to Earth, at the bottom right corner of the screen. 
If user enters the area with meteors, the game ends as spaceship is crushed. 
Once the spaceship completes the mission and lands on Earth, a winning screen will congratulate the user.

# Scoring
The rocket journey is being timed for 40 seconds before oxygen will be depleted. 
If you have successfully made it to Earth under 40 seconds, you will get a good ending. Failing to reach the Earth witin 40 seconds or traveling to the meteor direction will lead you to a bad ending.
Depending on the ending you might need to press 'r' key to restart, or click your mouse to return to the menu screen.

# Limitations
 Reloading the game is highly recommonmened because the rocket location will stay at the location where the player has last left it at. 
 The timer starts as soon as game is run. User might enter the game a few seconds in from the time spent at menu screen.
