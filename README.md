# Back to Earth 

Travel in a spaceship and manuever your way back to Earth. Collect all yellow stars to use as fuel for your spaceship. When you collect all of them, you can safely head back to earth. Use arrow keys to navigate through space. The arrow keys to have to be continuously pressed in the direction you wish to move for the rocket to keep moving. 

The rocket journey starts at 3 seconds and is being timed for 40 seconds before oxygen will be depleted. 

If you have successfully collected all the stars under 40 seconds, the spaceship will land safely on earth. Congratulations!

After 40 seconds, and the failure to collect all stars, you will be trapped in space and the game ends as you have died from suffocation. 

Depending on the ending you might need to press keys or click your mouse to return to the menu scree.
